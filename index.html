              <p>Sandy and Angels Acts of Kindness have a way of coming into your life when you need them the
              most. My experience being both an Angel’s team member and being a client of Angels has been
              absolutely great. Sandy is a once in a lifetime person and I feel very blessed and grateful having
              her in my life. She genuinely cares about myself and my children and did whatever she could to
              improve our lives. Being a single mother living in Albuquerque with minimal family around, it
                didn’t take long before I considered Sandy, Yolanda, Darrel, and Sam apart of my family too.</p>
              <p>
              Angel’s takes the time to get to know and build a relationship with the people they help so that
              these friendships last a lifetime. It is with Angel’s help that my little family knew we would
              never be alone out here and that we would always have people to turn to if we ever needed help.
              Their love and support led from a part time job with no housing to a stable environment with
              everything we needed to thrive because of the donations that were made to Angels. The same
              help that I received from Angel’s; I was also able to give to others in need. Anything from
              helping families with school supplies to helping whole communities on the reservation, it was
                always fulfilling knowing we helped improve someone’s life.</p>
              <p> This is the reason why I would like to encourage everyone to donate to Angel’s Acts of Kindness. Sandy is able to secure 75% off
              discounts on coats, clothing, and essentials for an empty kitchen so your donation will always go
              a long way and will help several families. You’re generosity is always needed and appreciated
              and could help changes someone’s life the way it did mine. Sandy is always there when you
              need her and has an infinite heart for helping others. She truly is an angel on Earth and will leave
                a positive impact on your heart for a lifetime.</p>
              <br>

              <p>It is such a rewarding experience volunteering with Angels Acts of Kindness as I have experienced so many families and individuals being blessed by the donated furniture, clothing and other household goods that we help deliver where they otherwise had little to nothing.  Imagine the joy that is left behind where they will sleep on a bed now instead of the floor.  Provisions from “Angels” enable so many to establish a home of their own.  I have seen how well connected “Angels” is with so many agencies and businesses that money donated is used to purchase food and goods for pennies on the dollar for those in need.  And donated furniture, clothing and other goods as well as financial support always has someone in need waiting for your generosity.</p>

            <p>We volunteered with Angels Acts of Kindness for over 3 years. It has become one of the greatest
            experiences in our lives because, while we may help people in need, we have discovered it is also a
            blessing to us. Sandy is truly an Angel who is there unconditionally when she is needed, knowlingly or
            unknowingly without judgement. The humility and natural generosity of mankind exist through people like
            Sandy who are blessed by Christ. We have been able to connect our extended families to join in to help
              with receiving estate items – picking out blessings and delivering them with Love in so many areas.</p>

            We have been supporting Angels, Acts of Kindness Inc. for approximately 28 years. Our first
            contact with this organization occurred when we were simply vacationing in Albuquerque. Our
            financial support began shortly after meeting the founders of this organization. After moving to
              New Mexico we began to volunteer with collection and distribution of donated goods.</p>
            <p>Our impression of the dedication of these volunteers has always been supported by their
            continued service, commitment and compassion to those in need. We have been amazed at the
            care and the enthusiasm they exhibit in providing real solutions for everyday needs people
            experience. They serve people with critical needs of all ages. From food to furniture, they pass
            along donations. They truly have a heart for the people here in New Mexico but also reach out
              to others in need elsewhere, such as hurricane victims and other natural disasters. </p>
            <p>What also sets this charity apart from others is the complete volunteer structure. Everyone
            works because they want to help others. All donations are returned to the community and not
            sold for profit.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, not all needs can be resolved through these donations. Funds are needed to
            keep a home heated in winter or a bus pass to get someone to work. The future of Angels
              depends upon that type of contribution to serve others needing a hand up.</p>
            <p>We encourage people to get involved. Donate time, energy and or money to help others. Let
              Angels be your partner in reaching others in your community.</p>

              We know of the numerous families who lost all their home; and Angels Acts of Kindness gave
              them furniture, etc. to help them restart their life. Our daughter donated a truck and they gave
              it toa a poor man who had his stole and had no way to get to work. We only give to Angels Acts
              of Kindness because their heart is in taking care of anyone in need.<br>

              <p>I’ve been blessed by the Lord to be able to contribute both financially and materially to
              AAOK throughout the years. I have been part of some of the large collection and distribution
              efforts made by Angels and marveled at the emptiness of the collection space at the end of
              distribution. This agency has served untold numbers of distributed household and provided
              basic needs for financially strapped college students trying to set up campus households.</p>
              <p>Angels will do their best to meet every need.</p>
              <p>Angels has enabled me to feel good about giving things I no longer needed and
              regaining precious space in my home; a freezer, hot water heater, TV, evaporative cooler to
              name a few; certainly a win for me and hopefully for the receivers.<br>

                  <p>The Angels team helping us was so much more than we could have hoped for with my wife’s cancer.  The special equipment for her medical care included an adjustable bed and a Jazzie electric chair.  </p>
                  <p>It gave her independence in the last few months.  Our utilities were off but Angels stabilized that situation.  Also wood was gathered and split for our fireplace.<br>
                    No one knows how much it means to have a visit and hope that AAOK brought us in our time of need.</p>
                  <p>Thank God for Volunteers and an organization that fives to meet so many needs in our community and the world they touch. </p>

                <p>I moved to Albuquerque N. Mx. for better climate.  I was struggling in so many ways.  A nurse in my card gave me an Angels card and said, “Call Sandi” – she was there the next day.</p>
                <p>The WISH list that she filled out for me began to materialize.</p>
                <p>In just a couple of weeks I had all the things delivered to set up my apartment &amp; transportation was provided &amp; worked out.</p>
                <p>Several months later I took a turn for the worse. </p>
                <p>They helped me even when I was diagnosed with cancer next to the heart.<br>
                  I wanted to go back home to be with my daughter.</p>
                <p>Sandi worked with my doctors &amp; prepared all the information for getting my care transferred to my home state.</p>
                <p>This group goes above and beyond everywhere, everytime.</p>
                <p>I think what is really needed is more good people like them, more funds for their wonderful support.</p>
                <p>Thank you for choosing to help Angels do more everywhere they go.</p>

                <p>Going thru some rough time as a student and father of a young child, I was able to pour out my heart.</p>
                <p>And there was Sandi.  This friendly, level headed lady that tells you “don’t give up!”  “I believe in you.”  And as all my families needs were met from diapers, to car repair &amp; help with college. Our world exploded into a better job, a future with a group to cheer us on.</p>
                <p>We went from small apartment to our first house.</p>
                <p>Each room filled with furnishings from Angels.</p>
                <p>We have volunteered for them and in so doing have our children giving too.<br>
                  Angels work is contagious.  The way they serve is phenomenal.  The only way they are limited is financially &amp; needing a larger place, giving them financial support.</p>
                <p>They can purchase many more supplies for education, for kindergarden to college.  Have more food distribution.  They teach you to believe you can make life better.</p>
                <p>“its all about choices!”  I will never forget a phone call from Sandi. </p>
                <p>Out of the blue she just called to encourage me.</p>
                <p>I was on a bus – ready to give up &amp; she heard my heart breaking.  She reminded me of my dream &amp; connected me with a man who hired me the very next day.<br>
                  A great job.</p>
                <p>Now my family is larger.  My hopes &amp; dreams are coming true.  All because a group of Angels restored my faith in God &amp; Humanity.</p>

                <p>I, Martin De La Cruz, am writing this letter on behalf of family in our community. </p>
                <p>Angels Acts of Kindness has been a tremendous help in our community for 13 years or more.  For instance a single mom of three little ones Angels provided clothing, food, coats, gifts and household products.  Angels also helped the Chavez family with food, clothing, funds for bills and some legal assistance.  Angels also helped the Sanchez family of 5 with many things. </p>
                <p>I don’t know where to start.  Angels Acts of Kindness has been a blessing in our community.  Thank you Sandy for all your help and all you and your family do in the city of Albuquerque.  Hundreds of visits by their teams have brought encouragement, warmth with coats and blankets and love – with all the spirit of Christmas all year. </p>
                <p>Great work!!!<br>

                <p>I met the Angels Group going thru cancer.  </p>
                <p>Sandi just walked up to me and said “how can we help?”</p>
                <p>That lead to a wonderful car that not only got me out of the cold to go to chemo treatments but also allowed me to finish school &amp; start a CPA business.</p>
                <p>When this Angel takes you to her heart Miracles happen &amp; blessings abound.  Not only does this organization help in life &amp; death situations but they believe in you.<br>
                  They ask what your dreams are &amp; gathering information from your answer, they find the tools you need to accomplish your goal.  Nothing compares to the personal attention &amp; 1 on 1 support that this encouragement brings into my life.</p>
                <p>Their organization provides everything they can.  They are like a butterfly.<br>
                  They listen &amp; they light the world with Kindness and compassion.</p>

                <p>The Grace &amp; compassion that walked in our door brought solutions we could address to change our lifestyle &amp; step by step, not only did they get us back to togetherness but got us back to being a family.

                <p>Angels has a special way of touching lives.  </p>
                <p>I know because we didn’t loose our home of 29 years.</p>
                <p>A stranger handed us a card &amp; said “Get ready to see things get better.”</p>
                <p>My husband was injured in an accident.</p>
                <p>Everything we had was on the line.</p>
                <p>Through Angels and their negotiations we were able to place our home in a moratorium for 6 months. </p>
                <p>Their agency provided counsel &amp; found us a way to breathe.  We were able to see our future.</p>
                <p>Our children received everything they needed to continue school.  Our home was saved.  My husband is back to work.</p>
                <p>Our lives are restored all because of this wonderful Angels Group.</p>
                <p>They are always there to hear your problems and find you options to choose from.</p>
                <p>Angels Acts of Kindness is always a miracle walking.</p>
                <p>We were 1 step from homeless &amp; now we are whole.</p>
                <p>Thank you Angels for all you do.</p>

                <p>My father was bedridden for over 15 years.  </p>
                <p>I saw television coverage on television and heard what great work AAOK does.  I call the night before Christmas eve knowing that if this was my dads last Christmas.  I wanted something good for him and for a new grandson not yet born.</p>
                <p>Sandi from Angels came that very afternoon and brought peaches and cream.  The bible on tape in Spanish was Cipriano’s, my dad, only language.  He rose to sit up in his bed.  </p>
                <p>Sandi came almost daily with food, prayers and clothing for all the extended household.  They helped to clean the acres so that our city wouldn’t [seize] the home he loved so much.  They replaced appliances and furnished hope all the time.</p>
                <p>Angels Acts of Kindness went above and beyond.  They built a play house for the neighborhood children so that he could see them play.</p>
                <p>When he was dying she gathered the children that he taught to be drug &amp; alcohol free and brought them to him for a blessing.  At her side as he was buried the children stood blowing kisses as he was put to rest.  He asked her to always provide for us.  She made the funeral happen.</p>
                <p>The Angel group has taken care of us bringing healing &amp; caring – school supplies – coats – mentorship comes in bunches with them.</p>
                <p>They are a wellspring of encouragement.</p>
                <p>I am proud to be their friend.<br>

                <p>I had the opportunity to become acquainted with Sandra and Angels Acts of Kindness when my grandfather was in dire need of paying a utility bill and Sandra helped minimize the bill.  From that moment on my family and I have been volunteers for Angels Acts of Kindness, which is a Christian owned and operated organization.  My family and I as well as Sandra continued assisting the great city of Albuquerque together as well as sharing the good news of hope and salvation through Jesus Christ.  Volunteering our services has been much pleasure because the needs are great, the laborers are few, and I believe many would have much more anxiety and stress without the support of Angels Acts of Kindness.</p>

                <p>Angels Acts of Kindness has been helping the residents at Bear Canyon Estates Independent
                    Retirement Community help others for several years and has been a bright light for both residents and
                    recipients. Bear Canyon Estates has a unique program called 'Seniors Serving Seniors/Society,' which
                    allows residents to contribute to helping making life better for other seniors and society. Bear Canyon
                    Estates residents have donated food, clothing, furniture, and more to Angels Acts of Kindness and will
                    continue to do so for many years. Angels Acts of Kindness then shares with the residents where there
                    items went and who they have helped. It is a win-win partnership because Angels Acts of Kindness can
                    continue to do the much needed work of helping those in need, while allowing Bear Canyon Estates
                    residents the privilege of serving others in the greater Albuquerque community. I would encourage
                    any individual, private business, and/or corporation to be a part of contributing to Angels Acts of
                    Kindness because it is in giving that we truly receive. Sandy and her team are truly angels on earth and
                    their work should be supported in every way possible be it by donations and/or monetary
                    contributions.</p>

              I support Angels, Acts of Kindness monetarily and by volunteering there because they embody the scripture from the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 25, verses 31-40, For I was hungry and you gave me food, i was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you took me in, I was naked and you clothed me and so on. This is what Angels does and so much more.<br>
